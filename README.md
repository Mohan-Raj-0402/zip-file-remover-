# zip-file-remover

Brute-forcing a zip file password becomes very slow as you increase:

* the number of characters in charset

* the max_length

Even max_length=5 with len(charset)=94 can take billions of attempts:

* `94^5 â‰ˆ 7.3 billion combinations`

## Installation
```bash
pip install pyzipper
